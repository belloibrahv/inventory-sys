/**
 * Money actually received in a window, by the day it came in.
 *
 * Home, Reports and Check the books used to add up what was paid on the sales
 * MADE in the window. That missed debts paid today on earlier invoices (Iwo
 * Road collected ₦800,000 on 26 September invoices on the 28th, so those
 * screens read ₦2,696,000 while the till, rightly, read ₦3,496,000), and it
 * counted a later payment on the day of the sale. Balance the till always
 * worked by the day money arrived; this makes the other screens agree.
 *
 * Sales saved before payment rows existed carry their money on the sale
 * itself, so those count on the day of the sale, as they always did.
